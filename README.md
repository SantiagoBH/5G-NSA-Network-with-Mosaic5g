# 5G NSA Network with Mosaic5g
Currently, there has been a significant increase in consumption of video streaming entertainment services, either due to the ease of choosing any type of series or movie on an electronic device that has an internet connection, or because of the various platforms that have been created in recent years with different proposals. However, data traffic has been increasing, negatively affecting network performance due to this high consumption of high-quality services. With the deployment of next-generation networks (5G), the development of mobile network deployments through open source code has been encouraged.

Currently, there are several alternatives to deploy an LTE, 5G Standalone (5G SA) or 5G Non-Standalone (5G NSA) network, such as open source software like Magma, Free5GC, Open5GC and OpenAirInterface. With the aim of analyzing the differences between each of the different options available for implementation and observing which is the most viable option to implement a 5G NSA network that is compatible with both next-generation devices (5G) and previous-generation devices (4G), this is in order to have the greatest possible compatibility.

For this project, the methodologies and functionalities of the technologies deployed by the Radio Access Networks (RAN) are considered for the analysis of the behavior of the video streaming service through open source software such as OAI-RAN and FlexRAN. In addition, the implementation of the Core Network (CN) with OAI-CN is required. Likewise, for the implementation of the network, the use of a Software Defined Radio Device (USRP) is necessary for the implementation of a prototype network that allows the analysis of different parameters, all with a Radio Frequency (RF) architecture that is designed by Software Defined Networks (SDN).
